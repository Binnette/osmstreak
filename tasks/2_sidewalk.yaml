title: Add a Sidewalk
emoji: 🚶🏿
description: >-
  Sidewalk is a footway near a road. For a better pedestrian routing, find a road without a sidewalk mapped,
  and draw two footways on the both sides (backed by the imagery) with an additional ''footway=sidewalk'' tag.
  Also add a crossing as a way in addition to a ''highway=crossing'' point: use ''footway=crossing'' for it.
test:
  created_2_ways: ["highway=footway", "footway=sidewalk"]
  created_way: ["highway=footway", "footway=crossing"]
