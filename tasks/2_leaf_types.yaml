title: Plant three trees
emoji: 🍂
description: >
  Mapping a tree is not just placing a ''natural=tree_node''. You have to specify its type.
  Please read wiki pages on [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:leaf_type leaf_type]
  and [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:leaf_cycle leaf_cycle], and then add 3 trees near your home or somewhere
  familiar to you using these tags.
test:
  created_3_nodes: ["natural=tree", "leaf_type=*", "leaf_cycle=*"]
