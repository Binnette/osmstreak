<h1>What is this</h1>
<p>OSM Streak makes you do small tasks for OpenStreetMap every day. The goal is to
map every day for at least a year. Tasks are small, five minutes each. The point
is to map every day, not map as much as you can. Persistence pays off.</p>
<h2>Points</h2>
<p>For each submission you get points. At first you get one point, from the
third day in a row you get two points for each task, and so on. If you keep
mapping for a month in a row, you would get five points for a changeset.</p>
<h2>Stars</h2>
<p>With points, you also may gain levels. You start at level 1: the number
of stars is the level you are at. In a few days you will move to level 2.
New levels open more tasks. Here are the point thresholds for gaining levels:</p>
<ul>
    <li>{{ levels[0] }} — level 2 (roughly five consecutive days)</li>
    <li>{{ levels[1] }} — level 3 (three weeks)</li>
    <li>{{ levels[2] }} — level 4 (three months)</li>
    <li>{{ levels[3] }} — level 5 (roughly a year)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mappers who get to the last level enter the hall of fame. They can continue
their mapping streak after that, of course. For each changeset at that moment
they will be getting 16 points.</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>You do not have to do exactly what the page tells you to. Any non-empty
changeset will be accepted. But if you follow the task description, you will
get an extra point.</p>
<h2>Leaderboard</h2>
<p>There is no leaderboard. You won't know who's ahead of you and who's behind.
This is a challenge, not a competition.</p>
